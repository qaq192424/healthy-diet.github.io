                A balanced diet and moderate exercise are extremely important for people. A balanced diet refers to choosing a variety of foods in appropriate portions to provide a range of nutrients and the right amount of calories to support the growth of body tissues, enhance immunity, and achieve a moderate weight. When eating, it is important to follow the portion ratios of the "food pyramid" and drink an adequate amount of water every day to promote health. A balanced diet helps the body function properly, contributes to disease resistance, keeps individuals energized, and maintains an ideal weight. To achieve an ideal weight, the most effective and sustainable approach is to maintain a healthy diet and engage in moderate exercise. Overconsumption of fried, excessively sweet, or salty foods can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other health issues that are detrimental to people's well-being.

                At every stage of life, it is important to prioritize brain health and protection because the brain is different from other parts of the body and requires adequate nutrition for its growth and development. Enhancing intellectual capacity and providing brain-boosting foods are essential to promote healthy brain development and delay cognitive decline. Once there is a nutritional imbalance, it is impossible to remedy it through any means in the future. Brain-healthy foods are considered precious for nourishing the body. However, in today's society, there is an abundance of additives, and natural and pure options have become rare. Therefore, if these foods are consumed improperly, they can be detrimental and even fatal.

                Many experts believe that a healthy diet has a significant impact on brain health, and nutritional intake is something that families can achieve easily and practically. To promote brain health through diet, it is essential to understand the nutrients that brain cells require. The main nutrients needed by the brain are lipids, specifically unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. Proteins, especially glutathione in proteins, carbohydrates in the form of glucose after digestion, and B-complex vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin E, and calcium are also important for brain function.
