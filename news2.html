                       Grandpa, how many times have I told you, don't put so much salt in the dish, you can't stand eating kidneys like this often! ”

                       "Don't talk nonsense here, I've eaten like this for most of my life, and I haven't seen my kidneys are bad, and I don't have high blood pressure, so I can eat it with confidence, there will be no problem!"

                       "I didn't show you so many authoritative experts said that you should eat less salt and less salt, otherwise it will lead to high blood pressure and bad kidneys, why don't you believe it?"

                       Whenever the conversation came to this point, Grandpa would end the conversation... Next time, continue to maintain the original habit of cooking, which makes Lei Lei very distressed. The old people in the family always think that they have been eating like this and are fine, why do they suddenly say that they can't eat more salt now? Isn't this a lie?
                   </p>

              
                      <h3>In the past, it was no problem to eat pickles every day, but now it is necessary to control salt to prevent and control high blood pressure?</h3>
					  <p class="tit1">
                          Before the old society, people had almost no additional oil and water intake other than three meals a day, let alone snacks containing salt. Most people solve a meal with white porridge with some pickles, so that the calorie and sodium content of a meal is less than a small piece of cheese or cream.

                          In the old days, people generally had a sodium deficiency, and even if they supplemented a little more, they would not exceed the standard. The diet structure and habits of modern people are very different from before, and the daily diet has a large number of foods with excessive sodium content in addition to three meals a day.
					            </p>
                    For example, the sodium content of a package of instant noodles is 2350mg, and the sodium content of a package of instant noodles reaches 2.3 grams, not to mention some common snacks, such as plum, shredded squid, biscuits, etc., the sodium content in these foods is also super high!

                    As long as you eat a snack every day, the sodium intake far exceeds that of people in the old era. In addition, people in the old times carried out more daily farming activities, and after a few hours of work, they would sweat a lot, and salt would be excreted with sweating.
